# PFA TOOLBOX
_A MATLAB toolbox for interval and possibilistic MFA_

Interval and Possibilistic MFA are two variants of Metabolic Flux Analysis (MFA), a widely used procedure to estimate the metabolic fluxes within living cells. 

# Features:

* Provides reliable MFA estimations in uncertain (or underdetermined) scenarios, where only a few fluxes can be measured.

* Provides MFA estimations accounting for measurements imprecision.

* Allows to easily plot interval estimates and flux distributions. 

* *Allow describing the measurements with a graphic interface.

* The toolbox is composed of simple MATLAB functions, which are flexible and can be modified by the user.

* It is compatible with the COBRA Toolbox.

* The toolbox is completely free.
