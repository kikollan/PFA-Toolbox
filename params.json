These methods overcome some limitations of traditional MFA, particularly in scenarios of uncertainty —where measurements are scarce and imprecise— which are indeed common in research laboratories and industry (see references below).\r\n\r\n**PFA Toolbox features**\r\n* Provides reliable MFA estimations in uncertain (or underdetermined) scenarios, where only a few fluxes can be measured.\r\n* Provides MFA estimations accounting for measurements imprecision.\r\n* Allows to easily plot interval estimates and flux distributions.\r\n*Allow describing the measurements with a graphic interface.\r\n* The toolbox is composed of simple MATLAB functions, which are flexible and can be modified by the user.\r\n* It is compatible with the COBRA Toolbox.\r\n* The toolbox is completely free.\r\n\r\nIf you want a more detailed description of PFA Toolbox, check the User's Manual. There you will find backgrounds, scientific details and several simple examples to illustrate the use of each function.\r\n \r\n*****\r\n## Download\r\n\r\nYou can download the *PFA Toolbox* [here](https://github.com/kikollan/PFA-Toolbox) by clicking in 'Download ZIP'.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nTo install the PFA Toolbox: \r\n\r\n1. Unzip PFA-Toolbox zip file. \r\n2. Copy the PFA Toolbox folder where you want it to be installed. \r\n3. Start MATLAB. \r\n4. Navigate to the PFA-toolbox/Toolbox_Code path.\r\n5. Run the following script, 'initPFAtoolbox'.\r\n\r\nThis action will add the *PFA Toolbox* directories to your MATLAB path and run the initialization script of YALMIP. The *PFA Toolbox* require solving linear programming problems, and these are solved using a flexible and efficient external optimizer: YALMIP. A copy of YALMIP is provided with the PFA Toolbox, but details about it can be found in [their webpage](http://users.isy.liu.se/johanl/yalmip/).\r\n\r\n****\r\n## References\r\n\r\nAbout Interval and Possibilistic MFA:\r\n* Llaneras F, Sala A, Picó J (2009).
