Something like this could be a suitable general reference (to write ö, use \"{o} in Latex. Note that o and ö are two completely different letters, and ö should never be written as oe.)

If you use the sum-of-squares module, a reference to the associated paper might be in place

Similarily, if you rely on the automatic dualization,

And finally the robust optimization module
